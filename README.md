- Details: 
   This is End-To-End Data Engineering Project using Airflow and Python. In this project, we will extract       data using Twitter API, use python to transform data, deploy the code on Airflow/EC2 and save the final result on Amazon S3


- I have done modification on this project interms of cloud usage on Azure. I have replaced:
    - EC2 to Azure VM(Ubuntu)
    - Amazon S3 to  Azure Storage Blob
